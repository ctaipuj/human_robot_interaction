# Myo Interaction *Developed by Paul Mouraud*

This package is under development based on the [myo_ros](https://github.com/uts-magic-lab/ros_myo.git) package using a [MYO gesture recognition armband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myo_armband).

The main purpose of the development is to achieve interaction with an industrial robot using human body's electromiographical signals.

## Requirements
In your `catkin_ws/src` directory:

`git clone https://github.com/uts-magic-lab/ros_myo.git`

Then compile your workspace.
